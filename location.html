        <h2>Saba, Carribean Netherlands</h2>
        <p class="description">Saba is often reffered to as the "unspoiled queen of the Caribbean" due to its lack of crowds, cruise ships, and chain stores. In 1987, the Saba Marine Park was established in order to protect the surrounding waters. There are twenty five stunning dive sites around the island, all with crystal clears waters and rich biodiversity. A few years ago Saba suffered a mass bleaching event. To help rebuild the reefs, the marine park now has twelve coral trees where they are growing staghorn coral. There is a team of people at the marine park who clean the trees daily and attach the coral onto the reef once it has grown sufficiently. Groups of university students from other countries will occasionally visit and help maintain the coral.</p>

        <h2>Kamalame Cay, Bahamas</h2>
        <p class="description">Kamalame Cay is a private island resort off of the largest island in the Bahamas, Andros. According to Travel &#43; Leisure, Kamalame Cay is the &#35;1 resort in Bermuda, The Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Coral reef growth is already limited in the Bahamas due to destructive hurricanes, so recent coral bleaching events have been anything but good. Kamalame Cay has a 10 by 10 ft coral table, but they are looking to expand by adding some coral trees as well. While we usually focus on growing branching coral because they grow faster, at Kamalame we are focusing on growing more sturdy coral such as brain coral. The increasingly devastating hurricanes have been very destructive in the Bahamas, so we are trying to grow coral that can protect the rest of the reef.</p>

        <h2>Bali, Indonesia</h2>
        <p class="description">Bali, Indonesia is home to some of the best dive spots in the world. Up to 40% of the coral around Bali has been bleached. To combat this there are 25 coral trees and 10 coral tables around the island, all ran by different organizations and resorts. While there are many people who regularly clean the trees and tables, what makes Coral Respawn in Bali unique is the amount of tourists that help out. Many of the resorts on the island run scuba diving and snorkeling trips to the growing coral. On these trips they allow the tourists to clean the coral and they also educate the tourists on coral bleaching and other dangers to our oceans. </p>

        <h2>Placencia, Belize</h2>
        <p class="description">Right off the coast of Placencia, Belize is the Belize Barrier Reef. The Belize Barrier Reef is the second largest coral reef system (the Great Barrier Reef off of Australia is the largest). This reef plays a very important role in protecting Belize from waves, storms, and floods. The reef has been a victim to a few mass bleaching events. The local marine conservation program in Placencia has 10 coral trees to help rebuild the reef. Tourists are allowed to visit the trees, but are not allowed to clean them as there has been a few incidents. Going on its tenth year, the coral restoration program has been extremely successful in Placencia and they hope to expand in the coming years.</p>
